paper_elements
--------------

A lightweight, custom, non-Polymer version of many of Google's popular Polymer elements
project that I rebuilt myself.

This project is used in my own projects and always in progress. I have fun rebuilding
things to learn, so feel free to use on your own or recommend new features to me.

Examples

Coming soon!
